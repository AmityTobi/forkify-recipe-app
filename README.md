# Forkify Recipe App 🍴

A modern recipe application built with **vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**, featuring recipe search, bookmarking, and user recipe uploads.

This project was developed as part of [The Complete JavaScript Course 2025](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.  
All design, starter code, and guidance credit goes to Jonas 🙌 — this repo is purely my implementation and practice.
